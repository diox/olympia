Dear add-on author,
{% if PASSING_ADDONS and not FAILING_ADDONS %}
Good news! Our automated tests did not detect any compatibility issues with your add-on{{PASSING_ADDONS|length|pluralize}} and {{APPLICATION}} {{VERSION}}. We've updated your add-on{{PASSING_ADDONS|length|pluralize:"'s,s'"}} compatibility to work with {{APPLICATION}} {{VERSION}} so that our Aurora users can begin using your add-on{{PASSING_ADDONS|length|pluralize}}.

We encourage you to view the results of the compatibility test, as some compatibility issues may have been detected but without enough certainty to declare the add-on incompatible:
{% elif FAILING_ADDONS and not PASSING_ADDONS %}
While testing add-ons for compatibility with the upcoming release of {{APPLICATION}} {{VERSION}}, we detected some potential compatibility issues with your add-on{{FAILING_ADDONS|length|pluralize}}.
{% else %}
While testing add-ons for compatibility with the upcoming release of {{APPLICATION}} {{VERSION}}, we detected some potential compatibility issues with your add-on{{FAILING_ADDONS|length|pluralize}}.

Our automated tests did not detect any compatibility issues with the following add-on{{PASSING_ADDONS|length|pluralize}} and {{APPLICATION}} {{VERSION}}. We've updated your add-on{{PASSING_ADDONS|length|pluralize:"'s,s'"}} compatibility to work with {{APPLICATION}} {{VERSION}} so that our Aurora users can begin using your add-on{{PASSING_ADDONS|length|pluralize}}.
{% endif %}{% comment %}

{% endcomment %}{% if PASSING_ADDONS %}
{% for addon in PASSING_ADDONS %}
 • {{addon.name}}: {{addon.links}}{% endfor %}

This compatibility bump is server-side and we did not modify your add-on package in any way.
{% endif %}{% comment %}

{% endcomment %}{% if FAILING_ADDONS %}
Because of these potential problems, we were not able to automatically mark the following add-on{{FAILING_ADDONS|length|pluralize}} as compatible with {{APPLICATION}} {{VERSION}}. Please look into these issues and upload a new version if necessary. If you've tested your add-on{{FAILING_ADDONS|length|pluralize}} and no changes are required, you can update your compatibility to {{APPLICATION}} {{VERSION}} on the developer hub page{{FAILING_ADDONS|length|pluralize}} below. No future compatibility tests will be run on {{FAILING_ADDONS|length|pluralize:"this add-on,these add-ons"}} until their compatibility information has been updated to include the latest {{APPLICATION}} release.
{% for addon in FAILING_ADDONS %}
 • {{addon.name}}: {{addon.links}} {{addon.compat_link}}{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

Thank you,
Firefox Add-ons team
